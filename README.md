# tic-tac-toe
Hey there! We all loved to play Tic-Tac-Toe while sitting in the class or spending some time with friends.
This is a digital version of the same!
2 players can simulataneously play this game. Player 1 gets to choose a marker and Player 2 is given its marker accordingly.
The program then randomly chooses which Player gets to go first.
The program prints a congratulations message if any player wins the game, else if the game is tied between the two players then it prints TIE.
After the game is over, the players get to choose if they would like to play the game again.
Enjoy!
